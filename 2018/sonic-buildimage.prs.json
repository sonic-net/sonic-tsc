In this case, we are increasing this value to 180 secs, so this is the time that it may take (in the worst case scenario) for the restarting router to re-learn state back from helper nodes. In this case we don't want fpmsyncd reconciliation process to kick off before we have had a chance to receive all the pending state. This artificial correlation between bgp-gr timer and fpmsyncd-timer is only needed today coz, at fpmsyncd level, we don't have a deterministic way to identify when the \"re-learning\" phase has concluded. Once we have this missing glue i agree that both timers can run independently.\r\n\r\n@zhenggen-xu Not sure i fully got your point, but looks like having separated per-platform/per-routing-stack values won't help in this case, as there seems to be a system fast-reboot limitation that is forcing us to increase this timer, and that will impact FRR in the same way that it affects Quagga. And yes, i agree that we will also need to change FRR values to be fully consistent.",

My point is specially valid for typical warm-reboot use-cases (daemon/docker restart), as in these scenarios both bgp-gr-timer and fpmsyncd-timer are going to be measuring similar things. On the other hand, i understand that this correlation is much weaker on the system-warm-reboot case, as both timers can/will diverge.\r\n\r\nQuestion is, which case should we optimize for? I feel that warm-restart scenarios (daemon/docker restart) are much more frequent than system-warm-reboot ones, so i'd rather cover the first scenario as best as we can. And perhaps we could go even further: forget about the system-warm-reboot case altogether, so that we can set more reasonable bgp-gr timers (~30 secs) and reduce the suboptimal-routing window. If we are interesting in optimizing for the warm-restart case, bgp-gr-timer and fpmsyncd-timer values would need to be (more and less) in-sync.",

This makes supervisord quite unstable in my opinion. Seems to me we should consider pushing forward for the suggestion in https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/pull/468#issuecomment-132756822 to be implemented if supporting older than Python 3 versions is important and an absolute must. Python 3 has been around for 10 years now.\r\n\r\nI am also concerned about supervisord's progress in addressing critical issues such as this one. It appears this has been known for 5+ yrs now yet hasn't been addressed. Perfectly fine for a home network but not good enough for something such as sonic.",

Any entry in the kernel that's also in the DB, is guaranteed to be valid and newer against what the DB has.\r\n\r\n@nikos-github To arp for all neighbors in DB should not cause problems as long as we don't overwrite the new entries with old state.

We could prioritize based on use-case. \r\n\r\n1. Issue with _gc_ threshold and flush of ARP entries\r\n2. Periodic refresh of link-local entries. \r\n3. Handle oper-down issue, where kernel does not delete the ARP entries but it might not be required to occupy HW resource for ARPs that belongs to a _down_ interface\r\n4. Handle admin-down scenario. If there are large number of ARP entries learnt on an interface, currently we rely on the the netlink notifications from kernel and this could be considerable depending on the interace. Instead a neigbhor manager could just act on the admin-down\r\n5. Handle ECMP neighbor refresh. If one or two ECMP neigbhor members are resolved and programmed to ASIC, I don't think there is a mechanism to resolve the remaining members of ECMP. This could be handled by Nbr-mgr. \r\n\r\n[Open]\r\n6. FDB age-out in kernel and if ARP is not refreshed, kernel floods the IP packet to all member ports of Vlan. \r\n7. Mgmt-VRF ARP reservation in case data-plane ARP fillsup the kernel threshold. \r\n",

        "body": "lguohan,\r\nHi, I'm Don Bollinger the author of optoe.  I am working on behalf of Finisar (major opto vendor), as the architect and implementer of the OCP Networking  Project 'OOM'.  The optoe driver is intended to provide better access to SFP and QSFP (and upcoming QSFP-DD/OSFP) EEPROM data.  It supports all MSA standard i2c devices under the SFF-8472 and SFF-8476 standards.  Optoe is being incorporated by 3 switch vendors right now (two of them are trying to submit optoe to you right now), and has already been accepted into the ONL public mainline for 6 switch platforms from two vendors (including one you are not working with right now.)  Bottom line:  optoe is real, solid, supported, an emerging industry standard.  I and Finisar are prepared to support it and extend it as needed to accommodate future devices and evolution in the Linux base.\r\n\r\nI have examined the version of sff_8436 in the patch you referenced above (https://github.com/Azure/sonic-linux-kernel/pull/20).  I don't think this particular patch supports SFP at all.  It doesn't have the 'sfp_compat' flag that other versions of that driver have, and it doesn't have any code to access the second i2c address (A2h or 51) that holds the majority of the SFP EEPROM data.  (Search for 'i2c_new_dummy' in earlier versions, note it is missing in this version.)  Finally, this version still has the reference to 'struct memory_accessor' which was removed at Linux 4.6.  I don't think this version will compile under Linux 4.9.\r\n\r\nI have the same code in optoe, since optoe is based on sff_8436.  I have a version that removes all the code that depends on struct memory_accessor (search for macc in optoe or in sff_8436).  I *think* it is safe to just remove that code, but that means kernel code can no longer access the EEPROM data (user space still can).  Is that OK?  Specifically, does Sonic use that macc/struct memory_accessor interface to access the sff_8436 driver?  If not, I can pull that code out, and submit it to Sonic.  You will then have a driver that supports at least two of your switch vendors, that works for SFP and QSFP, and that works under Linux 4.9.  But I need to know:  Does Sonic access the optical driver through the macc interface?\r\n",

We also ported to use macc interface. for v4.9, we haven't ported the sfp version to v4.9, but it should be not difficult given we have already ported the sff_8436 to 4.9. \r\n\r\nI found the sfp_compat useful for us since in some cases we use this [qsfp2sfp](http://www.mellanox.com/pdf/prod_cables/QSA.pdf) adapter. I believe in this case, the driver needs to dynamically detect the transceiver type which is supported in 8436 driver.\r\n\r\nalso need to check if any switch verdor use macc interface to access eeprom in the kernel or not. if there is any need, \r\n\r\nwould you be able to give an introduction for optoe driver in the coming Tuesday meeting 7-8AM? \r\n\r\n",
