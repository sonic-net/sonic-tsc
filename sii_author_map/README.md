# Deprecation Notice

Please do not add entries to [authors.csv](authors.csv) or
[authors.list](authors.list).  These are legacy files.  All new contributors
should be added to
[sonic-contributor-map/contributors.json](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-contributor-map/blob/main/contributors.json).

It is acceptable/recommended to remove members that have been added to the
legacy map that have been transferred to the contributors.json.
