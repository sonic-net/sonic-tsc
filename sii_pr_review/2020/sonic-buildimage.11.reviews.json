However, in this particular test, the data source is explicitly specified (tests/t0-sample-port-config.ini). So only changing the device type cannot test out the sources of port configuration data, and in this test setup, it does not seem the source of port configuration data could follow the `-k <device>` option. In using the command in SONiC, the `-k <device>` option should specify the data, and rendering the template should not be dependent on what kind of device it is. If you think the test case is indeed necessary, I think I need to copy the port config ini file for the device here and write another ground-truth json file for it. Let me know what you think.",

Thanks, Qi! I believe this was recently exposed because sonic-utilities recently started depending on swsscommon, which caused to to get installed in the build environment earlier than previously.\r\n\r\nI have opened a PR which should fix this: https://github.com/Azure/sonic-platform-daemons/pull/112",

Would you prefer that?\r\n\r\n- https://python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/subprocess.html?highlight=universal_newlines\r\n\r\nEdit: I have replaced all instances of `universal_newlines=True` with the new alias, `text=True`\r\n\r\nEdit 2: Unfortunately, I had to revert back to `universal_newlines=True` because sonic-py-common needs to continue supporting both Python 2 and 3, and `universal_newlines=True` is available in Python 2, whereas `text=True` was introduced in Python 3.4. Thus, we have to stick with `universal_newlines=True` until we completely remove support for Python 2, then we can change them to `text=True`.",

                "body": "The switch MAC address comes from the syseeprom on the ixs7215 just like most other boxes with syseeproms.  The previous et6448m marvell/delta product did not have a syseeprom so on that box the mac was placed into profile.ini early in boot up from uboot/ONIE env via a “virtual” syseeprom.   The mac address “00:50:43:ee:ee:ee “ is a “dummy” and is replaced with the boxes actual mac address at boot up.  I plan to push a change to sonic-py-common/sonic_py_common/device_info.py  early this week modifying the “get_system_mac” routine for ['asic_type'] == 'marvell'  to clean up the method there.  For marvell sai consistency the ixs7215 replaces the dummy mac with the actual syseeprom mac into profile.ini at boot via the nokia-7215init.service calling marvell-armhf/sonic-platform-nokia/7215/scripts/nokia-7215init.sh   The marvell sai uses the mac in that file.\r\n\r\nThanks, carl\r\n\r\nFrom: lguohan <notifications@github.com>\r\nSent: Saturday, November 7, 2020 7:32 PM\r\nTo: Azure/sonic-buildimage <sonic-buildimage@noreply.github.com>\r\nCc: Keene, Carl (Nokia - US/Westford) <carl.keene@nokia.com>; Author <author@noreply.github.com>\r\nSubject: Re: [Azure/sonic-buildimage] Platform: Add support for the Nokia-7215 platform (#5827)\r\n\r\n\r\n@lguohan commented on this pull request.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nIn device/nokia/armhf-nokia_ixs7215_52x-r0/Nokia-7215/profile.ini<https://github.com/Azure/sonic-buildimage/pull/5827#discussion_r519238818>:\r\n\r\n> @@ -0,0 +1,2 @@\r\n\r\n+switchMacAddress=00:50:43:ee:ee:ee\r\n\r\nare we hard coding the switch mac address here? and why?\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/Azure/sonic-buildimage/pull/5827#pullrequestreview-525695191>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/APFZCPMP7ZPXRAWMU5SI6ITSOXRJLANCNFSM4TLYH7YA>.\r\n",

I have a [pull request](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-buildimage/pull/5791) open to convert this script to Python 3 and use the logger from sonic-py common.  However, it seems you are more familiar with this script than I, so you would be able to test it more thoroughly. Would you mind also converting this script to Python 3 and use the logger from sonic-py common in this PR? If so, I will close my other PR.",

I think the crux of the issue is that if the ACLs are defined in an acl.json file and loaded using acl-loader, it will convert to all caps and also replace hyphens with underscores before pushing to Config DB. I originally wrote caclmgrd assuming that all ACLs will be loaded this way, and didn't consider the case where they would be manually entered into a config_db.json file and loaded. This, combined with the HLD you provided makes the case that caclmgrd should be able to handle both upper-case and lower-case.\r\n\r\nFor now, I think we can go ahead and add your change. However, the HLD might also need some clarification, as it states things like \"acl_table_name must be unique\" -- we might want to clarify that \"acl_table_name must be unique, regardless of case\" or similar.\r\n\r\nCan you please fix the conflicts here, since my other PR has merged to move the file and convert it to Python 3?",
