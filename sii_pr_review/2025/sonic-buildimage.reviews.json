It always happens only during the config reload when the DNS configuration changes.\r\n\r\n1. Dockerd starts the container with the current content of the \"resolv.conf\". It takes some time for the container to start and move into the \"running\" state.\r\n2. Meanwhile, concurrently, hostcfgd receives an event with the DNS configuration. It runs resolv-config.service, which writes the DNS configuration into the \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file and triggers the update of the containers.\r\n3. When the \"update-containers\" script starts, some Docker containers might not be in the \"running\" state yet, so the update for these containers can be missed.\r\n\r\nThe time window for this scenario is very small, which is why the issue has such a low reproducibility rate. In this scenario, waiting 5 seconds ensures that the Docker container has enough time to move into the running state.\r\n\r\n"

It always happens only during the config reload when the DNS configuration changes.\r\n\r\n1. Dockerd starts the container with the current content of the \"resolv.conf\" (copies it from the host). It takes some time for the container to start and move into the \"running\" state.\r\n2. Meanwhile, concurrently, hostcfgd receives an event with the DNS configuration. It runs resolv-config.service, which writes the DNS configuration into the \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file and triggers the update of the containers.\r\n3. When the \"update-containers\" script starts, some Docker containers might not be in the \"running\" state yet, so the update for these containers can be missed.\r\n```\r\n"

I'll enable bmp before all test cases as pre-condition via https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/pull/17963, and we can observe some days for the master run."

        "comment_body": "> hi @sudarshankumar4893\r\n> \r\n> 1. Could you split this PR into two separate PRs? The first one should focus on the VNET changes, and the second on enabling dynamic configuration of the IP range. Also, could you clarify why it is now acceptable to allow the VNET neighbor, whereas it wasn\u2019t before?\r\n> 2. Regarding the dynamic IP range configuration, could you provide a test plan for validating this using sonic-mgmt? Since dynamic config changes may potentially cause issues\u2014such as resetting or restarting BGP sessions\u2014we need to ensure the behavior aligns with expectations.\r\n\r\nhi @prsunny Do you have any concerns about allowing the VNET neighbor as a BGP neighbor? It was previously skipped, so I'm wondering if there were any known issues or limitations behind that decision?"

My manager Anish @anish-n told me to do that. Here is his original words:\r\n\"Enhance the existing yang model for VLAN_SUB_INTERFACE to include a field called vnet_name\r\nThere is already a vrf name, but needs to be enhanced for vnet_name\"\r\n\r\nIf this doesn't make sense, let me know and I will check with him.

I found a file here: https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt-common/blob/master/cvl/testdata/schema/sonic-interface.yang. May I kindly ask whether I need to update the `sonic-interface.yang` file here based on this PR's changes? Do the new changes for YANG model in `sonic-buildimage` always have to be synchronous with the yang models in `sonic-mgmt-common/cvl/testdata/schema/`?\r\n2. The missing import of `sonic-vnet` in `sonic-mgmt-common/models/yang/sonic/import.mk` might be the root cause.\r\n"

I believe we always assume certain number of fabric cards to be present in the system for this to work ? Also, any reason its different for 100g and 400g.\r\n\r\nThe different is not come from 100g or 400g nif port. they are depending on totally number of fabric links that expected to be up, and that could be different per sku . \r\n\r\nThe number needs to be greater than half of the links need to ready before enable the traffic in the chip, that's what broadcom suggested/guided us for J2. so I use that half # here for the high threshold. I also rounded up for the number, e.g Arista-7800R3A-36D2-C36 , depends on the type of fabriccards, each fap designed to use 144 links, 180 links or 179 links. so I put the number 91 as more than half of number in 180 case, and that should be even safe for all other cases. \r\n \r\nFor arista chassis, we never let the fap leave the topology, so I set the low threshold to 1. \r\n\r\n"

I'm not familiar with the release merging process, so I'll rely on you or others to determine which releases can incorporate this change so the others can be synced accordingly."

The change will have to be tested against mixed and py3 as it changes both sides of the code. "

        "comment_body": "> Just curios about PR description, you mentioned \"some race condition\". How bad is the bug? high chance or low change to repro? Please update PR description.\r\n\r\nadd more comments in description.\r\n\r\nThe race issue is in mgmt test case https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/blob/a354b1e5d665bfc2fd5d9a4b3b22fc3fa2f50592/tests/autorestart/test_container_autorestart.py#L309, \"docker exec container_name kill -SIGKILL -1\" is sent to every container.\r\n\r\nWhen a container receives the SIGKILL signal to terminate its processes, the order in which the processes are actually terminated can depend on the scheduling and resource availability within the container.\r\n\r\nScheduling: Within a container, processes are scheduled by the operating system or container runtime. The order in which the processes are scheduled to run can impact the order of termination. The scheduler determines which process gets executed first, and this can vary depending on factors such as process priorities, resource availability, and the scheduling algorithm used.\r\nResource Availability: Containers share resources such as CPU, memory, and disk I/O. When a SIGKILL signal is sent to all processes, the available resources might be limited or constrained. The order in which processes get terminated can be affected by resource contention. If resources are heavily utilized, some processes might be prioritized for termination over others due to resource constraints.\r\n\r\nas a result of this, if supervisor-proc-exit-listener is killed first before critical process, container auto-restart will not be launched as expected if we don't config autorestart=unexpected there."

(I wonder what the practical value of X is, i imagine maybe 10 if you don't have that many critical process). Then we can verify the same flake does not happen again.\r\n\r\nFor consistent repo, we can kill supervisor-proc-exit-listener first, then critical process exit will not restart docker container, I can add one additional test step for this into test_container_autorestart.py"

If DEVICE_NEIGHBOR is not defined, active ports are all ports, including PIE ports.\r\nSo the issue will happen, if PIE ports have device neighbor, or DEVICE_NEIGHBOR is not defined at all."

If you have 2 switches wired together with dual ports (for redundancy), you need each port to have a different mac address otherwise you have mac conflicts. At least on my Trident3 switches, every port defaults to the same system-wide mac address. So it is necessary."
