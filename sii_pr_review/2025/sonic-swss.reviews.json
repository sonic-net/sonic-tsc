It means this function is hit by 0, 0, 3, 0 times, hence a total of 0+0+3+0=3 times.\r\n\r\nBut in `coverage.xml`, this function is counted as hit by 0 times, because it only check the last `FNDA` in `coverage.info`.\r\n\r\nWhat this #PR3482 wants to fix is that, use --add-trace-file option for lcov, so that it could sum up all `FNDA`  to get the correct hit times for a function. Otherwise, some covered functions would be considered as missing, by mistake."
