None of the fixes/changes here should be needed in any current branch, I think.\r\n\r\n@saiarcot895 We usually cherry-pick only smartswitch related and build fixes from master to 202506 branch for swss-common, sairedis and dash-api, dash-ha repos. I took this change to avoid potential conflicts/build issues down the line."
