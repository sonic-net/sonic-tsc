Does that replace the entire CONFIG_DB, or does it merge into existing configuration?\r\n\r\nI do see it sets `os.environ['UTILITIES_UNIT_TESTING'] = \"1\"` in the `int_ip_input` which is used to `config` tests instead of `os.environ['UTILITIES_UNIT_TESTING'] = \"2\"` which is used in `show` tests but I don't see any docs on what that actually means.  Its not clear where to look in the code either for what it means."
