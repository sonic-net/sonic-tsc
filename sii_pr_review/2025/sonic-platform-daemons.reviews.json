From my understanding, the wait time should only apply to the first subport (specifically, the first subport to go through CMIS init for a breakout port group) of a physical port during CMIS initialization. For the remaining subports, the port should already be in high power mode, making the wait effectively a NOOP.\r\nIs the goal of this PR to reduce CMIS initialization time by allowing subsequent logical ports to proceed without waiting for the high power mode transition?\r\n\r\n2.

After applying this change, the link up time for 512 ports saves 20 to 30 seconds. You are right about the subport: only the first subport executes the wait. But it still took 64 * 0.5 = ~32 seconds. Also, the idea is that we don't need this wait in set_lpmode function since CmisManagerTask has already done the wait in state machine.\r\n\r\n"
