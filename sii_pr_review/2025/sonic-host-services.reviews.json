As it is right now, anyone with root access can execute _any_ command through DBUS.\r\n\r\nFair enough - just a question with this one, we don't necessarily know which commands need to be run by any given TSG, but the TSGs themselves will be audited and signed prior to deployment. Would a blacklist at the DBUS level be more suitable, to potentially block destructive operations, given that restriction? \r\n\r\n> * Currently there is no resource management and we can queue up an infinite amount of threads executing any commands. We should implement some simple pooling and throttling here.\r\n\r\nGood point, I'll add that to address those issues, thanks!\r\n\r\n> * We should log the command that is being executed for audit purpose.\r\n\r\nAlright, will do - just to clarify, some of the other modules are using `logging.logger`, would that be enough to be auditable (just not familiar with how host-services publishes the logs, apologies)? \r\n\r\n> * For test, consider using the command dbus-send (available in sonic device) to test issuing simple commands so we _only_ test this layer.\r\n\r\nSure, sounds good - I'll attach more test evidence using that, thanks!"

There is some overlap but it's great that the Debug endpoint is added in this PR which is aligned to the OpenConfig streaming Debug definition. We are working on adding the gNOI Debug RPC on the Frontend side which involves merging the TunnelCommand RPC to standard OpenConfig Debug definition. Thanks.\r\n"

(https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2869#section-5.14). So a RADIUS client including it should not in itself be an issue for a correctly behaving RADIUS server. If there are RADIUS servers not following the spec, then you might want to think of this knob. So the follow up question: are there any RADIUS servers out there that are not following the spec in this regard?  \r\n\r\n(2) If this knob is needed (and I probably think it is not), I'd keep it to all lower case, and use \"_\" (underscore to separate) the tokens in the knob (Eg: message_authenticator_required)."

It is enabled by default,\r\n#  to allow testing of the server after an initial installation.  If you\r\n#  are not going to be permitting RADIUS queries from localhost, we suggest\r\n#  that you delete, or comment out, this entry.\r\n#\r\n#\r\n\r\n#\r\n#  Each client has a \"short name\" that is used to distinguish it from\r\n#  other clients.\r\n#\r\n#  In version 1.x, the string after the word \"client\" was the IP\r\n#  address of the client.  In 2.0, the IP address is configured via\r\n#  the \"ipaddr\" or \"ipv6addr\" fields.  For compatibility, the 1.x\r\n#  format is still accepted.\r\n#\r\nclient localhost {\r\n        #  Only *one* of ipaddr, ipv4addr, ipv6addr may be specified for\r\n        #  a client.\r\n        #\r\n        #  ipaddr will accept IPv4 or IPv6 addresses with optional CIDR\r\n        #  notation '/<mask>' to specify ranges.\r\n        #\r\n        #  ipaddr will accept domain names e.g. example.org resolving\r\n        #  them via DNS.\r\n        #\r\n        #  If both A and AAAA records are found, A records will be\r\n        #  used in preference to AAAA.\r\n        ipaddr = 127.0.0.1\r\n\r\n        #  Same as ipaddr but allows v4 addresses only.

Using host names means that the\r\n        #  server will do DNS lookups when it starts, making it\r\n        #  dependent on DNS.  i.e. If anything goes wrong with DNS,\r\n        #  the server won't start!\r\n        #\r\n        #  The server also looks up the IP address from DNS once, and\r\n        #  only once, when it starts.  If the DNS record is later\r\n        #  updated, the server WILL NOT see that update.\r\n        #\r\n\r\n        #\r\n        #  The transport protocol.\r\n        #\r\n        #  If unspecified, defaults to \"udp\", which is the traditional\r\n        #  RADIUS transport.  It may also be \"tcp\", in which case the\r\n        #  server will accept connections from this client ONLY over TCP.\r\n        #\r\n        proto = *\r\n\r\n        #\r\n        #  The shared secret use to \"encrypt\" and \"sign\" packets between\r\n        #  the NAS and FreeRADIUS.  You MUST change this secret from the\r\n        #  default, otherwise it's not a secret any more!\r\n        #\r\n        #  The secret can be any string, up to 8k characters in length.\r\n        #\r\n        #  Control codes can be entered vi octal encoding,\r\n        #       e.g. \"\\101\\102\" == \"AB\"\r\n        #  Quotation marks can be entered by escaping them,\r\n        #       e.g. \"foo\\\"bar\"\r\n        #\r\n        #  A note on security:  The security of the RADIUS protocol\r\n        #  depends COMPLETELY on this secret!
