Does the submodule merge process run some additional tests that are not usually covered when the original change is tested?\r\nThe failure appears to be due to the environment where it is running.  It seems like on this environment ijson is not able to find the C-libraries required to set a default backend. \r\nOne way to fix this is to force a python backend.\r\n\r\nThe following single line change should fix it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- import ijson\r\n+ import ijson.backends.python as ijson\r\n```\r\n\r\n@deepak-singhal0408 recommended the use of this library. Deepak do you have any other suggestions/recommendations?"

However, when ijson is trying to use the yajl2 C backend via CFFI, CFFI tries to make a RWX memory mapping:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n    import ijson\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.13/dist-packages/ijson/__init__.py\", line 36, in <module>\r\n    backend = _default_backend()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.13/dist-packages/ijson/__init__.py\", line 32, in _default_backend\r\n    return get_backend(backend)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.13/dist-packages/ijson/__init__.py\", line 24, in get_backend\r\n    return importlib.import_module('ijson.backends.' + backend)\r\n           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.13/importlib/__init__.py\", line 88, in import_module\r\n    return _bootstrap._gcd_import(name[level:], package, level)\r\n           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.13/dist-packages/ijson/backends/yajl2_cffi.py\", line 88, in <module>\r\n    @ffi.callback('int(void *ctx)')\r\n     ~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/cffi/api.py\", line 396, in callback_decorator_wrap\r\n    return self._backend.callback(cdecl, python_callable,\r\n           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n                                  error, onerror)\r\n                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\nMemoryError: Cannot allocate write+execute memory for ffi.callback(). You might be running on a system that prevents this. For more information, see https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#callbacks\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs per the documentation, ijson would need to refactor their CFFI usage so that it doesn't use `ffi.callback()`. I don't know how much effort this requires on their part.\r\n\r\nThere are three workarounds:\r\n\r\n1. Add an override file for monit to disable `MemoryDenyWriteExecute`. This opens a security hole, so I'd discourage it.\r\n2. Add an override file to set the environment variable `IJSON_BACKEND=yajl2`. This uses ctypes instead of CFFI to talk to yajl2, and works without making a RWX memory mapping.\r\n3. Use `import ijson.backends.python as ijson` (as you suggested). This will work as well, but might reduce in lower performance.\r\n\r\nI personally prefer option 2, or maybe some hybrid of option 2 and 3 (try `import ijson.backends.yajl2 as ijson`, fall back to `import ijson.backends.python as ijson` if that fails), just to get the most performance possible."
