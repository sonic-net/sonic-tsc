The script already preferred jinjanator with j2cli as fallback, so I just fixed `apt install` \u2192 `apt-get install -y` (non-interactive) and added a PATH hint for pip `--user` installs.\n\nAgreed that jinjanator is the right long-term choice over Debian's j2cli packaging."

But by default its better we keep this enabled, so the benefits of nethop group sharing in kernel is available.."

It's impossible to connect the CLI with the countersyncd service. Because we have multiple methods to config HFT. Cli is just one of them. In the most time, we will use GNMI to config it which means the GNMI will directly inject configuration into config db instead of using CLI.\r\n2. In my humble opinion, if there is no data telemetry traffic under the countersyncd which means the HFT feature isn't enabled or configured, the countersyncd will be almost silent. It will only use tens of megabytes of memory and almost zero CPU.\r\n3. To the flag `otel-endpoint`, it's not a standard method to configure the endpoint of otel. The better way is to use the config db that mentioned in: https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/blob/master/doc/high-frequency-telemetry/high-frequency-telemetry-hld.md#742-high_frequency_telemetry_profile But we haven't supported that. This flag is exposed right now that is only used for simplifying testing flow."

I'm currently working on a PR to fix the generic libsnmp-dev issue, so it will also fix the libsnmp-dev issue that's causing the version-upgrade pipeline failure for 202505. But I'm still fixing some dependency issues for that PR, it may take some time. If it's urgent, I can create a PR to manually update the debian timestamp and snmp versions for 202505. Please let me know which works for you best.\r\n> \r\n> Oh that's great to hear! That will be very convenient once it goes it. Can we cherry-pick this to 202505 in the meantime? it's causing some big issues for our internal builds\r\n\r\n@yijingyan2 Could we also get it cherry-picked to 202411 as well? We're seeing the same issue there in local builds"

The PR checkers failed on test. They are known issues, just waiting for the fix PRs to be merged. After the PR checker pass, these two PRs can be merged into 202505 and 202411. Thanks"

And why we could take it as a signal of mgmtd initial config done?\r\n\r\nThanks Storm, The datastore lock is used to prevent other processes from accessing the datastore while mgmtd is using it.\r\nDuring startup, mgmtd acquires the datastore lock and releases it only after the initial configuration load is complete.\r\nTherefore, if the script reports that the datastore is not locked, it is safe to assume that mgmtd has finished its initial configuration."
