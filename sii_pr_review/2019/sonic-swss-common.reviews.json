When we use conffiles, if the config file already exists, installing deb pkg will give a prompt as below. The user needs to decide what to do next.\r\nDid somne search, looks there is no better to skip this prompt in deb pkg installing. If we use this way,  we need to add options when issusing \"sudo dpkg -i --force-confold libswsscommon_1.0.0_amd64.deb\" with --force-confold option to skip the prompt. Which means we need to modify all the build script which is using \"dpkg -i libswsscommon_1.0.0_amd64.deb\". This seems not good to me, it introduce more changes and did not get any big benefits. It also force installing to not overwrite existing files, which may be not good in future when there is a need to overwrite. Using manually copy in postinst can avoid this problem and didn't introduce extra changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nConfiguration file '/var/run/redis/sonic-db/database_config.json'\r\n ==> File on system created by you or by a script.\r\n ==> File also in package provided by package maintainer.\r\n   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:\r\n    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version\r\n    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version\r\n      D     : show the differences between the versions\r\n      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation\r\n The default action is to keep your current version.\r\n*** database_config.json (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? Y\r\n```",

Now the question is \"do we really want to add it into build docker ?\"  What's the difference between build docker having a default db config file at /var/run/redis/sonic-db/ and submodule Makefile coping(mkdir/mkdir) a db config file into /var/run/redis/sonic-db/  at build time ? They all changed the building system. The feedback at sairedis PR suggest NOT copy db config file into build system.  \r\n\r\nBTW , I am happy to have a db config by default in build docker, in this way, we don't need to worry about all the submodules who might miss db config file when doing some tests while building time. It will save my life. Can we go ahead with this approach ? Let me know and I can go head to adding it into build docker OR change each individual test case to have this db config file while building.

It has been communicated to Linux community and they are planning to change the man page of timerfd for real-time timers. \r\nyou may read the last two posts of this mail thread https://lists.gt.net/linux/kernel/3435187 . \r\n- We do see a possibility in the code where timerfd::read() could return 0 on monotonic timers but Linux community says it is only possible if hardware clocks (tsc in this case) are not in sync. We have been running several tests but haven't seen any problem in the hardware so far.\r\n- Our preference is to pick option 2 as it doesn't have any side effect.\r\n",

If read returns 0, when we can treat it as if it was an EOF, and ignore it. However, if it returns 1 <= retval < sizeof(uint64_t), instead of aborting as Renuka is doing, should we assume that the read() call was interrupted and attempt to read the remaining (sizeof(uint64_t) - retval) bytes?\r\n\r\nFrom http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timerfd_create.2.html:\r\n```\r\nOperating on a timer file descriptor\r\n       The file descriptor returned by timerfd_create() supports the follow‐\r\n       ing operations:\r\n\r\n       read(2)\r\n              If the timer has already expired one or more times since its\r\n              settings were last modified using timerfd_settime(), or since\r\n              the last successful read(2), then the buffer given to read(2)\r\n              returns an unsigned 8-byte integer (uint64_t) containing the\r\n              number of expirations that have occurred.  (The returned value\r\n              is in host byte order—that is, the native byte order for inte‐\r\n              gers on the host machine.)\r\n\r\n              If no timer expirations have occurred at the time of the\r\n              read(2), then the call either blocks until the next timer\r\n              expiration, or fails with the error EAGAIN if the file\r\n              descriptor has been made nonblocking (via the use of the\r\n              fcntl(2) F_SETFL operation to set the O_NONBLOCK flag).\r\n\r\n              A read(2) fails with the error EINVAL if the size of the sup‐\r\n              plied buffer is less than 8 bytes.\r\n\r\n              If the associated clock is either CLOCK_REALTIME or\r\n              CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM, the timer is absolute\r\n              (TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME), and the flag TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET was\r\n              specified when calling timerfd_settime(), then read(2) fails\r\n              with the error ECANCELED if the real-time clock undergoes a\r\n              discontinuous change.  (This allows the reading application to\r\n              discover such discontinuous changes to the clock.)\r\n```",

Since ProducerStateTable itself is a HSET, the routes keys are the same and they should not consume memory increasingly, but rather limited to maximum number of routes.  A few thousands or even 100 thousand routes does not consume much memory.  By looking at the redis debug output, it is clearly showing some buffer are going up during the routes flaps:\r\n//# redis-cli info Clients\r\n//# Clients\r\nconnected_clients:241\r\nclient_longest_output_list:3625\r\nclient_biggest_input_buf:0\r\nblocked_clients:0\r\n\r\n//# redis-cli info Clients\r\n//# Clients\r\nconnected_clients:241\r\nclient_longest_output_list:40067\r\nclient_biggest_input_buf:0\r\nblocked_clients:0\r\n\r\n//# redis-cli info Memory\r\n//# Memory\r\nused_memory:660227456\r\nused_memory_human:629.64M\r\nused_memory_rss:608448512\r\nused_memory_rss_human:580.26M\r\n\r\nAnd one of the client is not able to consume the published data:\r\nid=216812 addr=/var/run/redis/redis.sock:0 fd=178 name= age=84281 idle=5 flags=U db=0 sub=1 psub=0 multi=-1 qbuf=0 qbuf-free=0 obl=0 oll=41954 omem=845197440 events=rw cmd=subscribe\r\n\r\nMore debugs show that this is not the app_db PS table but some publish channel. \r\n\r\nComa back to the code, before the PR,  the publish of the key/value is per request, while after the PR changes, the publish only happens if key set didn't exist before.\r\n\r\nWith the PR, based on testing, the memory does not build up anymore on Redis even with slow consumer as both ProducerStateTable and Notifications would be capped to maximum number of entries. \r\n\r\n$ sudo redis-cli info clients\r\n//# Clients\r\nconnected_clients:241\r\nclient_longest_output_list:411\r\nclient_biggest_input_buf:0\r\nblocked_clients:0\r\n...\r\n$ sudo redis-cli info clients\r\n//# Clients\r\nconnected_clients:241\r\nclient_longest_output_list:357\r\nclient_biggest_input_buf:0\r\nblocked_clients:0\r\n\r\n$ sudo redis-cli info Memory \r\n//# Memory\r\nused_memory:16743648\r\nused_memory_human:15.97M\r\nused_memory_rss:22810624\r\nused_memory_rss_human:21.75M\r\n",

                "body": "@qiluo-msft thanks for the comments!  \r\n@zhenggen-xu found that this optimization does reduce the duplicate notifications for the same key. At very busy scenario,  the redis memory hog issue remains being seen though at slower rate than before.\r\n\r\nFurther debugging shows that even for unique notification per key, that is still too much for orchagent to handle.  In consumer_state_table_pops.lua,  we are performing batch spop for the key set.  The default batch value is 128,  orchagent has increased it to 8192.  That means if there are 8192 unique keys in the key set, only the first notification is taking real affect, the other 8191 notifications are consuming both memory and cpu power.   What makes it worse, in the case of route flapping, the keys are unique at different time span though they are repeating themselves,  unprocessed notification keeps accumulating.\r\n\r\n@zhenggen-xu and I are trying further optimization,  there are some challenges with regards to the select() and redis publish processing.  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
