If you remember, we're now configuring NTP after all Dockers have started due to the fact Supervisor doesn't properly handle the clock rolling backward in between process state changes. We found that there was still a chance that ntp-config gets started while some Dockers were still starting up. This delay is to ensure that all Supervisor processes in all Dockers have finished starting up processes before NTP has a chance to roll the clock backward. This PR and #2335 are interim solutions until we can get a version of Supervisor which uses the monotonic clock.",

Yes, it should be read only once every field has been set well in chassis_tbl. The question is where to set all the fields. As it is involved from the new platform API, current no logic to cover it. From my point of view, each daemon should set the related fields of chassis_tbl by themselves. \r\nFor 7th. Not sure the other platforms. But on MLNX platform, num_psu will not change during system live. If PSU is taken out, there is a file in Sysfs will indicate the \"precense\" is \"0\" of this PSU.\r\n\r\nFor other comments, such as comments correction, logging, error handling, I think it should be more likely an improvement task for all the daemons in sonic-platform-daemon repo. It is good for improving the robustness of the daemons, but I would suggest covering those items in a separate commit as the purpose of this commit is just to add the PSU daemon.",

Do we have many places for defining it? Why not create a single place? I believe you will need it also for all the rest of the daemons in pmon.\r\n4.\tSame comment for log functions. Why they are different from one daemon to another? I believe some input param should to the trick for all daemons in pmon\r\n5.\tLine #166 can stat_db be null? Should you verify and place error handling?\r\n6.\tLine #171 what is the logic behind chassis_tbl? Should it read only once in system life cycle?\r\n7.\tLine #172 can the num_psu changed during the system live? How you handle PSU taken out?\r\n8.\tLine #179 Can psu_db_update fails?
