I suspected the failure was introduced by https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss-common/commit/40a685cd8d72f61c2b7b27ca0e34547ec0876de9. But haven't got a chance to reproduce. "

To fix this issue run the command 'echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled' as root, and add it to your /etc/rc.local in order to retain the setting after a reboot. Redis must be restarted after THP is disabled.\r\nJun 27 13:54:08.191206 277ed3813ef0 INFO #/supervisord: redis-server 104:M 27 Jun 2022 13:54:08.191 * Ready to accept connections\r\nJun 27 13:54:08.191534 277ed3813ef0 INFO #/supervisord: redis-server 104:M 27 Jun 2022 13:54:08.191 * The server is now ready to accept connections at /var/run/redis/redis.sock\r\nJun 27 13:54:09.195817 277ed3813ef0 INFO #supervisord 2022-06-27 13:54:09,193 INFO success: redis-server entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for > than 1 seconds (startsecs)\r\nJun 27 13:54:09.197087 277ed3813ef0 INFO #/supervisord: start.sh redis-server: started\r\nJun 27 13:54:09.824316 277ed3813ef0 INFO #/update_chassisdb_config: remove chassis_db from config file /var/run/redis/sonic-db/database_config.json.tmp\r\nJun 27 13:54:09.836892 277ed3813ef0 INFO #/supervisord: start.sh /usr/bin/configdb-load.sh: line 4: sonic-db-cli: command not found\r\nJun 27 13:58:17.722624 277ed3813ef0 INFO #supervisord 2022-06-27 13:58:17,721 INFO reaped unknown pid 164 (terminated by SIGTERM)\r\nJun 27 13:58:17.725611 277ed3813ef0 INFO #supervisord 2022-06-27 13:58:17,724 INFO reaped unknown pid 358 (terminated by SIGTERM)\r\n```\r\n\r\n@qiluo-msft Looks like every PR in sonic-swss-common has this problem"

When poll_descriptors break by siguser, it will return to python code and python code will re-run poll_descriptors method, so from the python code side, the behavior not change.\r\n\r\nHowever. there are some UT failed, seems related with this change, will check reason.\r\n\r\nUpdate: in latest code, only sigint can break the while loop, all other signal will not break the while loop."
