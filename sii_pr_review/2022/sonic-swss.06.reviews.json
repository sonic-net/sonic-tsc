The weight sent to kernel is the configured weight -1, where that logic is not in the message to FPM. I believe we need to take kernel value as root of truth, thus in fpmsyncd we compensate that with +1 logic in order to retrieve the desired weight setting from routing stack. The best solution is to patch SONiC version of FRR so that the weight value sent to FPM agrees the one sent to kernel. ",

Yes, it confirms that user space weight is always +1 of what is in the kernel. The fpmsyncd should increment the weight only if it is receiving route updates from kernel (as what iproute2 does.) Given that fpmsyncd receives updates from frr (instead of kernel) in the default build image, it shouldn't increment the weight.\r\n\r\nIn order to take care of such scenarios, there should be awareness of where the updates are coming from and handle it accordingly.",
