It is the definition as per the SAI model. When an IP address and subnet, say _**10.1.1.1/24**_ is on a RIF, the following set of routes are created as per SAI:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@sonic-dut:~# config interface ip add Ethernet120 10.1.1.1/24\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-10-07.14:41:31.066482|c|SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_ROUTER_INTERFACE:oid:0x60000000004f2|SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_ATTR_VIRTUAL_ROUTER_ID=oid:0x3000000000276|SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_ATTR_SRC_MAC_ADDRESS=00:30:64:68:63:43|SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_ATTR_TYPE=SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_TYPE_PORT|SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_ATTR_PORT_ID=oid:0x1000000000132|SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_ATTR_MTU=9100\r\n2024-10-07.14:41:31.071107|c|SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_ROUTE_ENTRY:{\"dest\":\"10.1.1.1/32\",\"switch_id\":\"oid:0x21000000000000\",\"vr\":\"oid:0x3000000000276\"}|SAI_ROUTE_ENTRY_ATTR_PACKET_ACTION=SAI_PACKET_ACTION_FORWARD|SAI_ROUTE_ENTRY_ATTR_NEXT_HOP_ID=oid:0x1000000000125\r\n2024-10-07.14:41:31.081518|C|SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_ROUTE_ENTRY||{\"dest\":\"10.1.1.0/24\",\"switch_id\":\"oid:0x21000000000000\",\"vr\":\"oid:0x3000000000276\"}|SAI_ROUTE_ENTRY_ATTR_NEXT_HOP_ID=oid:0x60000000004f2\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.  10.1.1.1/32 to CPU (SAI\\_ROUTE\\_ENTRY\\_ATTR\\_NEXT\\_HOP\\_ID points to CPU port). The CPU queuing is controlled using SAI\\_HOSTIF\\_TRAP\\_TYPE\\_IP2ME,\r\n2.  _**10.1.1.X/24 route**_ : **This route points to CPU (In the SAI API model, this is done by setting SAI\\_ROUTE\\_ENTRY\\_ATTR\\_NEXT\\_HOP\\_ID as the RIF). However, there is no standard hostif trap defined to control the CPU queuing behavior.**\r\n\r\nNote: Both the routes are created with SAI\\_PACKET\\_ACTION\\_FORWARD and not SAI\\_PACKET\\_ACTION\\_TRAP.\r\n\r\nBoth these routes can achieve the functionality by changing the packet action to Trap and use UDTs; but the standard SAI definition is to use SAI\\_PACKET\\_ACTION\\_FORWARD and the NH will point to CPU and RIF for route 1 and 2 respectively.\r\n\r\nPlease refer : [https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/blob/f23185d5baf25ef27afb2d5823559d4d3e9c7022/inc/sairoute.h#L78:](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/blob/f23185d5baf25ef27afb2d5823559d4d3e9c7022/inc/sairoute.h#L78:) \"Directly reachable routes are the IP subnets that are  \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \\* directly attached to the router.

So to avoid the credit watchdog timer flushing the voq during sonic-mgmt Qos tests, we need to disable the credit watchdog timer and enable it back after the test. \r\nThe SAI attribute SAI_SWITCH_ATTR_CREDIT_WD was not present in the older SAI versions and got added in SAI 10.X. So this PR adds the sai-thrift support to enable or disable the SAI_SWITCH_ATTR_CREDIT_WD for Voq systems."

To allow this, MACsec flow - which is a logical encapsulation has list of SC's.\r\n\r\nWhen I defined the API, I did not intend a flow to be used for multiple ports.  In fact the only intended use case for multiple SCs attached to a flow was for a single ingress port as described in Fig-4 and the text below it in https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/blob/master/doc/macsec-gearbox/SAI_MACsec_API_Proposal-v1.4.docx\r\n\r\nBut while considering this PR, I realized nothing prevented someone from binding the ACL and SC for 2 ports to 1 MACsec flow.  That could allow the same flow (aka vPort) policy to be applied to multiple ports (if the hardware permitted it).  And the safer approach was to attach a port to a flow, because nobody should attach the same SC to 2 ports of a device.  If you think *nobody* has shared a flow for  multiple ports, and there an imperative to attach the port to a flow, please go ahead and do it.  I would not have done it, because attaching a port to an SC works equally well and seems safer."

For further insights, refer to the documentation at: https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/blob/master/doc/dualtor/active_active_hld.md. In this scenario, both links present the same IP and MAC address to the server, a configuration that is incompatible with BFD  due to its requirement for unique IP addresses for a single hop / direct links."

Original requirement is from SONIC dualtor use case. \r\n\r\nYou are right about IP addresses. Thank you correcting me. \r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t explain clearly. I meant to mention the following of RFC 5881:\r\n......\r\nInitialization and Demultiplexing\r\n\r\n   In this application, there will be only a single BFD session between\r\n   two systems over a given interface (logical or physical) for a\r\n   particular protocol.  The BFD session must be bound to this\r\n   interface.  As such, both sides of a session MUST take the \"Active\"\r\n   role (sending initial BFD Control packets with a zero value of Your\r\n   Discriminator), and any BFD packet from the remote machine with a\r\n   zero value of Your Discriminator MUST be associated with the session\r\n   bound to the remote system, interface, and protocol.\r\n......\r\nFor example, in case of SONIC dualtor active-active use case, there will be two sessions between ToR and server over a single physical link. The server basically duplicates ICMP heartbeat to both ToRs, that means each tor will receive TWO icmp replies. One originates from local, the other is from peer.  That way, a ToR can monitor the health status of  server link and  its peer ToR as well. \r\n\r\nCouple of other reasons that I think this will help: \r\n-\tNot all NF/devices support BFD as compared to ICMP.  \r\n-\tBFD has overhead of session establishment and negotiation. \r\n\r\nPlease correct me If I\u2019m wrong or  have missed something. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nChikke\r\n"

I incorporated the the document in the PR in md format\r\n2. I mentioned in example that using set property cable type can be set.\r\n3. Yes it is correct, Run diagnostics command runs for both cable pair status and cable length in this case  but it is implementation specific. The cable length information can be cached once Cable Pair status is requested, it can be read at the same time and can be stored to read latter.\r\n    "
