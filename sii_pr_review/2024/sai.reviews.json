How do you differentiate between ICMP echo response being dropped because of other network conditions instead of link down?\r\n> \r\n>     3. ICMP packets are typically handled in slow path.

In this context, \"link down\" encompasses both scenarios.\r\n3. Yes, that's correct. However, it should function with other combinations (such as HW offload to SW module, or SW module to SW module implementations) as long as the configured intervals accommodate the expected transaction rate or slowness."

Original requirement is from SONIC dualtor use case. \r\n\r\nYou are right about IP addresses. Thank you correcting me. \r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t explain clearly. I meant to mention the following of RFC 5881:\r\n......\r\nInitialization and Demultiplexing\r\n\r\n   In this application, there will be only a single BFD session between\r\n   two systems over a given interface (logical or physical) for a\r\n   particular protocol.  The BFD session must be bound to this\r\n   interface.  As such, both sides of a session MUST take the \"Active\"\r\n   role (sending initial BFD Control packets with a zero value of Your\r\n   Discriminator), and any BFD packet from the remote machine with a\r\n   zero value of Your Discriminator MUST be associated with the session\r\n   bound to the remote system, interface, and protocol.\r\n......\r\nFor example, in case of SONIC dualtor active-active use case, there will be two sessions between ToR and server over a single physical link. The server basically duplicates ICMP heartbeat to both ToRs, that means each tor will receive TWO icmp replies. One originates from local, the other is from peer.  That way, a ToR can monitor the health status of  server link and  its peer ToR as well. \r\n\r\nCouple of other reasons that I think this will help: \r\n-\tNot all NF/devices support BFD as compared to ICMP.  \r\n-\tBFD has overhead of session establishment and negotiation. \r\n\r\nPlease correct me If I\u2019m wrong or  have missed something. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nChikke\r\n"

Detection can be performed in a few miliseconds. Also, this greatly helps if switchover from active to standby done in the HW directly. \r\n"

I incorporated the the document in the PR in md format\r\n2. I mentioned in example that using set property cable type can be set.\r\n3. Yes it is correct, Run diagnostics command runs for both cable pair status and cable length in this case  but it is implementation specific. The cable length information can be cached once Cable Pair status is requested, it can be read at the same time and can be stored to read latter.\r\n    "
