BFD SAI API is already defined\r\n\r\nThis requirement pertains to the SONIC Dualtor scenario, which employs an ICMP-based link prober. For further insights, refer to the documentation at: https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/blob/master/doc/dualtor/active_active_hld.md. In this scenario, both links present the same IP and MAC address to the server, a configuration that is incompatible with BFD  due to its requirement for unique IP addresses for a single hop / direct links."
