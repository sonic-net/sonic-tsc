With the next commit of porting wpa-supplicant openssl 3.0 support in which you are working now you should remove two of the flags. This may take a while as code change is significant thus needs significant testing for macsec. This PR will make sonic to be able to build macsec containers under bookworn before real support is in."

We will have a second PR to fix the deprecated warning and const cast warning issue by uses high level opennssl APIs. This will be a huge change so needs time to code and test. This one is just unblock us as replacing with high level APIs needs some effort. Currently there's PR in sonic-buildimage branch waiting for this PR to be in so macsec can be built under bookworm."
