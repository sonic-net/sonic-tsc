The test change in this PR adds the `hdel` mock method. I believe It would be good to have a test to exercise the exception logic added in this PR; e.g. \r\n\r\n(a) when the PSU is missing\r\n(b) when the power_good status is False\r\n(c) when the fan is missing.

The issue is not related to platform.json or hwsku.json. It is just related to adding/removing logical port. DPB CLI will remove the existing logic port and create new ones no matter what platform.json/hwsku.json is. You can use `config interface breakout <interface> <mode>` on ANY interface with ANY valid mode to reproduce the issue, but you may need to run it in a while loop for few hours to hit the race condition.\r\n2. I found the root cause not by analyzing the syslog. Actually, there is no clue in the syslog. I found the issue by reading the code. So, I am not sure that providing the trace is helpful to understand the issue. \r\n\r\nExample, say we are going to break Ethernet0 to (Ethernet0 and Ethernet2)  :\r\n1. It removes Ethernet0 first, `TRANSCEIVER_STATUS|Ethernet0` will be removed from TRANSCEIVER_STATUS table\r\n2. It adds Ethernet0 back to CONFIG_DB, both SfpStateUpdateTask and DomInfoUpdateTask notice the new logic port.  SfpStateUpdateTask and DomInfoUpdateTask run in two different thread. So, there could be 2 possible cases:\r\n  a. SfpStateUpdateTask get port add event first. No issue for this flow.\r\n  b. DomInfoUpdateTask get port add event first. This flow causes issue. See below.\r\n\r\nLet discuss case b:\r\n1. DomInfoUpdateTask get port add event first. It calls update_port_transceiver_status_table_hw which will populate a few data to `TRANSCEIVER_STATUS|Ethernet0`, but it does not populate \"status\" field.\r\n2. Then, SfpStateUpdateTask gets new port add event. It calls on_port_config_change -> on_add_logical_port and hit the line:\r\n```\r\n        logical_port_event_dict[port_change_event.port_name] = dict(sfp_status)['status']   <===== crash because 'status' is not a valid key in dict(sfp_status)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`TRANSCEIVER_STATUS|Ethernet0` has no 'status' field yet, so the above line get an KeyError and crashes. \r\n\r\nI hope this is clear now."

In the optical cables context, 'channel' is a concept which already widely used and has a clear definition, we even have SONiC platform APIs defined to handle optical cable 'channels'. I suggest to use use another name to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nAnother point is that not sure the 'channel' number should be provided explicitly from some configuration, can it be deduced by some logic? It's shouldn't be too complicated."

This also relies on the fact that redis-db will always populate info for all subports in a physical port group before xcvrd actually starts using info for a subport.\r\nIn addition to this, the current physical to logical port list is not in sorted order and will need to be sorted in appropriate order before using it."

Somehow it has been moved to the section before this comment. \r\n --  Before this PR, these \"FABRIC_ASIC\" entries will be removed if stop chassisd or PMON (which trigger the de_init). The entries will be recreated when chassisd or PMON is restarted. Function module_updater.module_db_update() will recreate them. We have manaully test it. But, after this PR, these fabric entries will not be removed when PMON/chassis is stopped. \r\n"
