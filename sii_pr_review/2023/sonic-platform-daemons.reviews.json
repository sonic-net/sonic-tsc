If a temperature sensor is from a device that is bad then there is very little reason to include in the temperature db as it provides the user with minimally useful information while muddling the information stored in the db and causing issues in some tests (to my knowledge tests like platform_tests/test_thermal_state_db.py require the sensors to be readable). My issue with keeping the sensors in the db for devices that are present is that it does NOT tell us if the issues are with the sensor or the PSU and could provide the user with misleading information (especially with N/A values as, in my opinion with this scope of info that the cli provides, they really don't tell the user much useful information at all because of how vague it is). Also, in regards to helping \"to indicate there is some issue with the psu\", while these temperature sensors could potentially provide additional context, I am of the opinion that that is something that should really only fall under the purview of `show platform psustatus`, the temperature cli is defined as focusing on the status of the temperature sensors, if a device  is not in good operation, should the user blanket trust the values its temperature sensors are reporting (some PSUs could have temperature sensors that would still work while others wouldn't)?\r\n\r\n@prgeor I think this comes down to what we want to pursue as the intent of the `show platform temperature` command, should it show all 'expected' sensors (all thermal sensors from devices that are present) or should it only show 'expected' sensors from devices that are operational as its definition does not clarify this... \r\n\r\n@keboliu \r\nThere is no reason to display the sensors of devices that are not present. It only serves to confuse the user. No meaningful data can be gleamed by populating this db with what is practically trash information. While a device may have (and expect) multiple PSUs for example, if it can function with one PSU then what purpose does providing empty information points actually serve? I don't think removing this info from the db obscures anything, it just ensures that the platform provides the db with information the platform actually has about its' devices rather than also outlining what would be akin to ghost information...\r\n\r\n\r\n"

There is an argument to be made for keeping the information from the thermal sensors of PSUs in not good power status (though I still don't think they should personally as the provide potentially confusing and incorrect information). But for not present PSUs, there is zero information being provided by zero readable sensors. `show platform temperature` has no reason to show non readable sensors from non present devices. If a device requires two PSUs then `show platform temperature` is not the place to enforce that. This CLI should only show actual information regarding the state/information of sensors on devices that are actually present. The purpose of this change is that the information provided by the CLI is unclear as it does not have a way to designate N/A values meaning. It could be anything from not present to not on to not functioning."

It absolutely makes no sense to display components that are not even present.  It is up to the user to decide whether they want to populate all the PSU slots or just keep it at minimum (to save cost perhaps, or in the middle of RMA replacement). Redundancy is not a must especially if the device purpose is not mission critical for the user.  \r\nSo for components that are not present we should make the change and not keep them in the stateDB.  I don't think the current behavior is correct and we should fix it with this PR.\r\n\r\n@gregoryboudreau, I also do not agree to remove BAD PSUs that are \"present\" from the stateDB from being displayed by \"show platform temperature\". We must trust the \"Presence\" signal and still attempt to read out the sensors. We don't know if we can trust the sensor data if the PSU is bad.  But it does provide some useful info with readout that raise concerns in case it went bad or in the process of becoming bad with temperature swings read out so that it allows us to detect and perform troubleshooting/RMA before it totally goes dead.  It could be that it got declared as \"BAD\" way too early or falsely and in that case as long as the PSU is \"present\", the temperature data can provide some usefulness. Temperature changes is a good way to provide alert signals.  Also, this provides one additional signal that we can use besides totally depended on \"show platform psustatus\" to detect the problem.  I do not think all bad PSU cases will lead to no temperature sensor can be read out.  As long as the component is \"present\" we should try to read out the temperatures from it.  Can you change the PR to restore the readout for PSUs that are \"present\"?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

To reiterate on what @gechiang said, it does not make sense to display sensors for devices that are not present. This does **not** provide the user with any usable information. While a device may have (and expect) multiple PSUs for example, if it can function with one PSU then what purpose does providing empty information points actually serve? The purpose of this CLI is to \"displays the status of the device's thermal sensors.\" If a device is not present, then there are no thermal sensors to be read, so I don't see any reason to include them. Please explain why this information about the sensors on a device that is not present are important to this CLI. Additionally, if a user wants insight into the state of the device, they can use `show platform psustatus`. "

Displaying 'N/A' for temperature sensors in `show platform temperature` that are not present makes the CLI ambiguous as to whether they are faulty or just not present.\r\n\r\nWhat is the intended behavior for `get_all_thermals` when called on a non-present module? If that case should not return any thermals, it should be clearly documented in the base class and vendor code can be adjusted to comply. That would negate the need for a presence check in this PR."

Are you saying that Cisco platform code on 202205 does not have the implementation to support this yet? This is a surprise for me.  Given that this fix was causing regression, it got backed out from 202205. Only if you think all regression issues are fully addressed for 202205, we can then try to pick this up again.  Please add dependency PRs for the 202205 branch here so we clearly know what order the PRs should be merged in order to not cause any regressions.  Also, we must not cause regressions on other vendor platform test as well.  So, if there is any dependency on other Vendors to also need to make changes in their platform code for 202205 then we should not request this be backported to 202205.  Can you clarify on this so we can make a decision for 202205 accordingly?\r\nThanks!"

The test change in this PR adds the `hdel` mock method. I believe It would be good to have a test to exercise the exception logic added in this PR; e.g. \r\n\r\n(a) when the PSU is missing\r\n(b) when the power_good status is False\r\n(c) when the fan is missing.

The issue is not related to platform.json or hwsku.json. It is just related to adding/removing logical port. DPB CLI will remove the existing logic port and create new ones no matter what platform.json/hwsku.json is. You can use `config interface breakout <interface> <mode>` on ANY interface with ANY valid mode to reproduce the issue, but you may need to run it in a while loop for few hours to hit the race condition.\r\n2. I found the root cause not by analyzing the syslog. Actually, there is no clue in the syslog. I found the issue by reading the code. So, I am not sure that providing the trace is helpful to understand the issue. \r\n\r\nExample, say we are going to break Ethernet0 to (Ethernet0 and Ethernet2)  :\r\n1. It removes Ethernet0 first, `TRANSCEIVER_STATUS|Ethernet0` will be removed from TRANSCEIVER_STATUS table\r\n2. It adds Ethernet0 back to CONFIG_DB, both SfpStateUpdateTask and DomInfoUpdateTask notice the new logic port.  SfpStateUpdateTask and DomInfoUpdateTask run in two different thread. So, there could be 2 possible cases:\r\n  a. SfpStateUpdateTask get port add event first. No issue for this flow.\r\n  b. DomInfoUpdateTask get port add event first. This flow causes issue. See below.\r\n\r\nLet discuss case b:\r\n1. DomInfoUpdateTask get port add event first. It calls update_port_transceiver_status_table_hw which will populate a few data to `TRANSCEIVER_STATUS|Ethernet0`, but it does not populate \"status\" field.\r\n2. Then, SfpStateUpdateTask gets new port add event. It calls on_port_config_change -> on_add_logical_port and hit the line:\r\n```\r\n        logical_port_event_dict[port_change_event.port_name] = dict(sfp_status)['status']   <===== crash because 'status' is not a valid key in dict(sfp_status)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`TRANSCEIVER_STATUS|Ethernet0` has no 'status' field yet, so the above line get an KeyError and crashes. \r\n\r\nI hope this is clear now."

In the optical cables context, 'channel' is a concept which already widely used and has a clear definition, we even have SONiC platform APIs defined to handle optical cable 'channels'. I suggest to use use another name to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nAnother point is that not sure the 'channel' number should be provided explicitly from some configuration, can it be deduced by some logic? It's shouldn't be too complicated."

This also relies on the fact that redis-db will always populate info for all subports in a physical port group before xcvrd actually starts using info for a subport.\r\nIn addition to this, the current physical to logical port list is not in sorted order and will need to be sorted in appropriate order before using it."

Somehow it has been moved to the section before this comment. \r\n --  Before this PR, these \"FABRIC_ASIC\" entries will be removed if stop chassisd or PMON (which trigger the de_init). The entries will be recreated when chassisd or PMON is restarted. Function module_updater.module_db_update() will recreate them. We have manaully test it. But, after this PR, these fabric entries will not be removed when PMON/chassis is stopped. \r\n"
